# Cognitive Bias Decision Checklist

Based on "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman

## Pre-Decision Check (Before Making Decision)

### 1. Anchoring Effect
- [ ] Have I cleared my initial assumptions and first impressions?
- [ ] Am I anchored to irrelevant information (like random numbers or first opinions)?
- [ ] Have I considered multiple starting points or perspectives?

**Action**: Delay judgment, capture structure, verify understanding

### 2. Availability Bias
- [ ] Am I only considering easily recalled examples?
- [ ] Are recent experiences dominating my thinking?
- [ ] Have I sought diverse perspectives and historical data?

**Action**: Theme-based diverse reading, cross-domain note-taking, seek counterexamples

### 3. Confirmation Bias
- [ ] Am I only looking for evidence that supports my initial preference?
- [ ] Have I actively sought disconfirming evidence?
- [ ] Have I considered alternative explanations?

**Action**: Actively seek counterexamples, use "devil's advocate" approach, red team exercises

### 4. Overconfidence
- [ ] Am I overestimating my knowledge or prediction accuracy?
- [ ] Have I used external benchmarks (historical data, industry norms)?
- [ ] Have I considered the possibility of being wrong?

**Action**: External perspective, premortem analysis, reference class forecasting

### 5. Loss Aversion & Endowment Effect
- [ ] Am I overvaluing what I already have?
- [ ] Is my fear of loss preventing me from taking beneficial risks?
- [ ] Have I considered both gains and losses objectively?

**Action**: Reframe as opportunity cost, consider both sides equally

### 6. Base Rate Neglect
- [ ] Am I ignoring statistical base rates in favor of specific stories?
- [ ] Have I considered the general probability before the specific case?
- [ ] Am I using causal narratives instead of probability thinking?

**Action**: Start with base rates, then adjust for specific information

### 7. Regression to the Mean
- [ ] Am I attributing extreme outcomes to specific causes?
- [ ] Have I considered that extreme results often regress to average?
- [ ] Am I using statistical thinking rather than causal thinking?

**Action**: Distinguish signal from noise, use statistical benchmarks

## Decision Process (During Decision-Making)

### 8. External Perspective
- [ ] Have I consulted similar past decisions or industry benchmarks?
- [ ] Have I asked experienced people for their perspective?
- [ ] Have I used reference class forecasting?

**Action**: Look at historical data, consult experts, use statistical baselines

### 9. System 2 Activation
- [ ] Am I thinking slowly and deliberately, not just relying on intuition?
- [ ] Have I forced myself to consider the decision from multiple angles?
- [ ] Am I using structured decision-making tools?

**Action**: Delay judgment, use decision matrices, force slow thinking

### 10. Frame Analysis
- [ ] How is this decision framed? (gain vs loss, success vs failure)
- [ ] Would reframing change my decision?
- [ ] Am I being influenced by the framing rather than the facts?

**Action**: Reframe in neutral language, consider multiple frames

### 11. Loss Aversion Check
- [ ] Am I avoiding losses more than seeking equivalent gains?
- [ ] Have I considered both the upside and downside objectively?
- [ ] Is my risk tolerance appropriate for this decision?

**Action**: Consider opportunity costs, evaluate both sides equally

### 12. Mental Accounting
- [ ] Am I treating money/effort differently based on its source or purpose?
- [ ] Have I considered the decision in terms of total utility?
- [ ] Am I creating artificial categories that bias my decision?

**Action**: Consider total impact, avoid artificial categorization

## Post-Decision Validation (After Making Decision)

### 13. Premortem
- [ ] If this decision fails, what went wrong?
- [ ] What are the potential failure modes?
- [ ] Have I identified and mitigated key risks?

**Action**: Imagine failure scenario, identify root causes, create mitigation plans

### 14. Risk Policy
- [ ] Should this be a rule rather than a one-time decision?
- [ ] Would a policy help avoid future frame effects and emotional interference?
- [ ] Can I create a systematic approach for similar decisions?

**Action**: Create decision rules, establish policies for recurring decisions

### 15. Two Selves Check
- [ ] Am I optimizing for experience self (real-time feelings) or memory self (story)?
- [ ] Will this decision create good memories but bad experiences (or vice versa)?
- [ ] Have I balanced both perspectives?

**Action**: Consider both immediate experience and long-term memory, balance both

### 16. Overconfidence Validation
- [ ] Have I accounted for uncertainty in my predictions?
- [ ] Have I set up feedback mechanisms to learn from outcomes?
- [ ] Am I prepared to adjust if my predictions are wrong?

**Action**: Acknowledge uncertainty, set up monitoring, prepare to pivot

## Decision Quality Indicators

A high-quality decision should have:

- ✅ Multiple perspectives considered (external + internal)
- ✅ Counterevidence actively sought
- ✅ Statistical thinking applied (not just causal narratives)
- ✅ System 2 engaged (not just System 1 intuition)
- ✅ Frame effects identified and addressed
- ✅ Risk and uncertainty acknowledged
- ✅ Feedback mechanisms in place

## Red Flags (Warning Signs)

Stop and reconsider if you notice:

- 🚩 You're only seeing evidence that supports your preference
- 🚩 You're ignoring base rates or statistical data
- 🚩 You're overconfident about predictions
- 🚩 You're making the decision based on a single frame
- 🚩 You're avoiding the decision due to loss aversion
- 🚩 You haven't sought external perspective or benchmarks
