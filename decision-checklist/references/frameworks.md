# Decision-Making Frameworks

Based on "Thinking, Fast and Slow" principles

## 1. External Perspective Framework

### When to Use
Before making any significant decision, especially when you feel confident.

### Steps
1. **Find Reference Class**: Identify similar past decisions or industry benchmarks
2. **Gather Data**: Collect statistics, historical outcomes, expert opinions
3. **Calibrate**: Adjust your internal estimate based on external data
4. **Acknowledge Uncertainty**: Recognize the range of possible outcomes

### Example
**Decision**: "Should I start a business?"

**External Perspective**:
- Reference class: Similar businesses in my industry
- Data: 50% fail in first 5 years (base rate)
- Calibration: My specific advantages/disadvantages vs average
- Uncertainty: Even with advantages, success is not guaranteed

## 2. Premortem Framework

### When to Use
After you've made a preliminary decision but before finalizing.

### Steps
1. **Assume Failure**: Imagine the decision has failed completely
2. **Identify Causes**: List all possible reasons for failure
3. **Assess Likelihood**: Evaluate how likely each cause is
4. **Mitigate Risks**: Create plans to address high-likelihood failure modes

### Example
**Decision**: "I'll invest in this startup"

**Premortem**:
- Failure scenario: Investment loses all value
- Possible causes:
  - Market conditions change (high likelihood)
  - Team execution fails (medium likelihood)
  - Technology doesn't work (low likelihood)
- Mitigation: Diversify, set clear milestones, maintain exit options

## 3. Frame Analysis Framework

### When to Use
When the decision feels obvious or when you're strongly drawn to one option.

### Steps
1. **Identify Current Frame**: How is the decision currently framed?
2. **Reframe**: Restate in neutral or opposite terms
3. **Compare**: Would you make the same decision with the new frame?
4. **Choose Best Frame**: Select the frame that best represents reality

### Example
**Decision**: "Should I take this job?"

**Frame Analysis**:
- Current frame: "Gain: Better salary and growth"
- Reframe: "Loss: Leave current stability and relationships"
- Reframe 2: "Opportunity cost: What else could I do?"
- Best frame: Consider both gains and losses, plus alternatives

## 4. System 2 Activation Framework

### When to Use
When you feel an intuitive pull toward a decision (System 1 is active).

### Steps
1. **Delay**: Don't decide immediately, give yourself time
2. **Structure**: Use a decision matrix or structured analysis
3. **Verify**: Check your reasoning with someone else
4. **Validate**: Look for evidence that contradicts your intuition

### Example
**Decision**: "This feels like the right choice"

**System 2 Activation**:
- Delay: Wait 24 hours before finalizing
- Structure: Create decision matrix with criteria and weights
- Verify: Discuss with trusted advisor
- Validate: Actively seek reasons why it might be wrong

## 5. Risk Policy Framework

### When to Use
For recurring decisions or when emotions might interfere.

### Steps
1. **Identify Pattern**: Is this a type of decision you make repeatedly?
2. **Create Rule**: Establish a policy that applies to all similar decisions
3. **Document**: Write down the rule and criteria
4. **Apply Consistently**: Use the rule, not case-by-case judgment

### Example
**Decision**: "Should I invest in this opportunity?"

**Risk Policy**:
- Pattern: I'm frequently presented with investment opportunities
- Rule: Only invest if (1) I understand the business, (2) Risk is <10% of portfolio, (3) Expected return >20%
- Document: Written investment policy
- Apply: Evaluate all opportunities against this policy, not emotions

## 6. Two Selves Balance Framework

### When to Use
For decisions that affect both immediate experience and long-term memory.

### Steps
1. **Experience Self**: What will the actual experience be like?
2. **Memory Self**: What story will I tell about this decision?
3. **Identify Conflict**: Do experience and memory point in different directions?
4. **Balance**: Make decision that honors both, or consciously choose which to prioritize

### Example
**Decision**: "Should I take a vacation or save money?"

**Two Selves Analysis**:
- Experience self: Vacation provides immediate joy and relaxation
- Memory self: Saving money creates security and future options
- Conflict: Immediate pleasure vs long-term security
- Balance: Take shorter, cheaper vacation that satisfies both

## Decision Matrix Template

Use this structure for complex decisions:

| Criteria | Weight | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|----------|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| Criterion 1 | X% | Score | Score | Score |
| Criterion 2 | X% | Score | Score | Score |
| Criterion 3 | X% | Score | Score | Score |
| **Total** | 100% | **Total** | **Total** | **Total** |

**Instructions**:
1. List all relevant criteria
2. Assign weights (must sum to 100%)
3. Score each option on each criterion (1-10 scale)
4. Calculate weighted scores
5. Consider: Does the highest score align with your intuition? If not, investigate why.
