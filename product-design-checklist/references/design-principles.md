# Product Design Principles Based on Cognitive Science

Based on "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman

## Core Principle: Design for System 1, Design with System 2

**Users think with System 1** (fast, intuitive, emotional) - Design output should align with this.
**Designers should use System 2** (slow, rational, analytical) - Design process should use this.

## Design Output Principles (Aligning with User Cognition)

### 1. Leverage Anchoring Effect

**Principle**: Users' judgments are anchored to initial information.

**Design Applications**:
- **Pricing**: Three-tier pricing with middle tier as anchor
- **Features**: Show premium features first to anchor expectations
- **Defaults**: Strategic default selections guide behavior
- **Progress**: Progress indicators anchor completion expectations

**Example**: 
- Show "Pro Plan $99/month" first, then "Basic Plan $29/month" feels like a deal
- Default to "Recommended" option in selection flows

### 2. Harness Loss Aversion

**Principle**: Users feel losses about 2x more strongly than equivalent gains.

**Design Applications**:
- **Messaging**: "Don't miss out" vs "Get this benefit"
- **Trials**: "Free trial - cancel anytime" reduces perceived risk
- **Notifications**: "You have 3 unread messages" (loss of information)
- **Gamification**: "Don't lose your streak" vs "Continue your streak"

**Example**:
- "Avoid costly mistakes" positioning
- "Don't let your data expire" warnings
- Risk-free trial periods

### 3. Design for Peak-End Rule

**Principle**: Users remember peak moments and endings, not the full experience.

**Design Applications**:
- **Onboarding**: Memorable welcome moment
- **Achievements**: Celebration animations for milestones
- **Completion**: Satisfying end to workflows
- **Error Handling**: Turn errors into positive moments

**Example**:
- Welcome animation on first use
- Confetti on task completion
- Thank you page after purchase
- Helpful error messages with solutions

### 4. Create Cognitive Ease

**Principle**: Users prefer things that are easy to think about.

**Design Applications**:
- **Clarity**: Simple, clear interfaces
- **Consistency**: Consistent visual language
- **Familiarity**: Use familiar patterns
- **Positive Emotions**: Pleasant colors, friendly copy

**Example**:
- Clean, uncluttered layouts
- Consistent iconography
- Familiar navigation patterns
- Warm, friendly tone

### 5. Apply Framing Effect

**Principle**: How information is framed affects decisions.

**Design Applications**:
- **Positive Frames**: "90% success rate" vs "10% failure rate"
- **Gain Frames**: "Save 2 hours" vs "Don't waste 2 hours"
- **Social Proof**: "Join 10,000 users" vs "Don't be left out"
- **A/B Testing**: Test different framings

**Example**:
- "Unlimited storage" vs "No storage limits"
- "Free forever" vs "No credit card required"
- "Trusted by millions" vs "Join millions"

### 6. Understand Mental Accounting

**Principle**: Users mentally categorize money/effort differently.

**Design Applications**:
- **Pricing**: Subscription vs one-time payment framing
- **Bundling**: Logical product categories
- **Rewards**: "Treat yourself" vs "Investment" categories
- **Payment Methods**: Credit vs debit mental models

**Example**:
- "Coffee money" vs "Investment money" pricing
- Bundled features into logical groups
- Separate accounts for different purposes

### 7. Leverage Endowment Effect

**Principle**: Users value things more once they have them.

**Design Applications**:
- **Personalization**: Customizable interfaces
- **User Content**: User-generated content
- **Progress**: Visible progress and history
- **Ownership**: "Your dashboard", "Your data"

**Example**:
- Personalized home screens
- User-created playlists
- Progress bars and achievements
- "My" language throughout

## Design Process Principles (Avoiding Designer Biases)

### 8. Use External Perspective

**Principle**: Reference similar projects and industry benchmarks.

**Design Process**:
- Look at competitor designs
- Reference industry standards
- Consult experienced designers
- Use design system guidelines

**Example**:
- Before designing checkout flow, review 10 e-commerce sites
- Reference Material Design or Human Interface Guidelines
- Consult with senior designers

### 9. Apply Premortem Analysis

**Principle**: Imagine the design fails, identify why.

**Design Process**:
- Assume feature launches and fails
- List all possible failure reasons
- Assess likelihood of each
- Create mitigation plans

**Example**:
- Premortem: "Feature fails because users don't understand it"
- Mitigation: Add tooltips, improve onboarding, user testing

### 10. Seek Disconfirming Evidence

**Principle**: Actively look for evidence that contradicts your design.

**Design Process**:
- Test with users who might not like it
- Ask about problems, not just benefits
- Listen to criticism
- Test edge cases

**Example**:
- Show design to skeptical users
- Ask "What would make you not use this?"
- Test with users outside target audience

### 11. Use Statistical Thinking

**Principle**: Distinguish signal from noise, use probability thinking.

**Design Process**:
- Look at aggregate data, not just anecdotes
- Understand regression to mean
- Distinguish correlation from causation
- Use A/B testing for validation

**Example**:
- Don't attribute single user complaint to design flaw
- Understand that extreme results often regress
- Test with sufficient sample sizes

### 12. Avoid Availability Bias

**Principle**: Don't let recent or vivid feedback dominate.

**Design Process**:
- Build feedback database
- Review historical feedback
- Don't over-weight recent examples
- Consider all user segments

**Example**:
- Maintain feedback log with timestamps
- Review feedback from past 6 months
- Don't redesign based on one angry user

## User Research Principles

### 13. Measure Both Selves

**Principle**: Distinguish experience self (real-time) from memory self (retrospective).

**Research Methods**:
- **Experience Self**: Real-time usage analytics, session recordings
- **Memory Self**: Surveys, interviews, retrospective feedback
- **Both**: Compare what users say vs what they do

**Example**:
- Track: Time on task, error rates, completion rates (experience)
- Ask: "How was your experience?" (memory)
- Compare: If memory positive but experience negative, investigate

### 14. Understand Peak-End in Research

**Principle**: Users remember peaks and endings in feedback.

**Research Methods**:
- Ask about specific moments, not just overall
- Measure full journey, not just highlights
- Don't over-weight memorable moments
- Distinguish peak from average experience

**Example**:
- "What was the best moment?" + "What was the worst moment?"
- Track full user journey, not just key pages
- Don't redesign based on one peak moment

### 15. Frame Questions Neutrally

**Principle**: How questions are framed affects answers.

**Research Methods**:
- Use neutral language
- Avoid leading questions
- Test different question framings
- Randomize question order

**Example**:
- ❌ "How much do you love this feature?"
- ✅ "How would you rate this feature?"
- Test: "Rate ease of use" vs "Rate difficulty"

## Implementation Checklist

When designing a new feature:

- [ ] **Design Output**: Applied System 1 principles (anchoring, loss aversion, peak-end, etc.)
- [ ] **Design Process**: Checked System 2 biases (planning fallacy, overconfidence, etc.)
- [ ] **User Research**: Measured both experience and memory selves
- [ ] **External Perspective**: Referenced benchmarks and similar projects
- [ ] **Premortem**: Imagined failure scenarios and mitigated risks
- [ ] **Disconfirming Evidence**: Sought and addressed negative feedback
- [ ] **Statistical Thinking**: Used data, not just anecdotes
